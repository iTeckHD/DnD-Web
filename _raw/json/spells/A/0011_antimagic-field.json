	"description": "A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds\r\nyou. This area is divorced from the magical energy that\r\nsuffuses the multiverse. W ithin the sphere, spells can’t\r\nbe cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m agic\r\nitems becom e mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere\r\nm oves with you, centered on you.\r\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created\r\nby an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere\r\nand can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast\r\na suppressed spell is consum ed. W hile an effect is\r\nsuppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends\r\nsuppressed counts against its duration.\r\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,\r\nsuch as magic missile and charm person, that target\r\na creature or an object in the sphere have no effect\r\non that target.\r\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical\r\neffect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.\r\nIf the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of\r\nthe area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.\r\nFor example, the flames created by a wall o f fire are\r\nsuppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall\r\nif the overlap is large enough.\r\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a\r\ncreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while\r\nthe creature or object is in it.\r\nMagic Items. The properties and pow ers of\r\nm agic items are suppressed in the sphere. For\r\nexample, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a\r\nnonm agical longsword.\r\nA m agic w eapon’s properties and pow ers are\r\nsuppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or\r\nwielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a m agic w eapon\r\nor a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere\r\n(for example, if you fire a m agic arrow or throw a magic\r\nspear at a target outside the sphere), the m agic of the\r\nitem ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\r\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel\r\nfail to w ork in the sphere, whether the sphere is the\r\ndestination or the departure point for such magical\r\ntravel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of\r\nexistence, as well as an opening to an extradim ensional\r\nspace such as that created by the rope trick spell,\r\ntemporarily closes while in the sphere.\r\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object\r\nsum m oned or created by m agic temporarily w inks out\r\no f existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly\r\nreappears once the space the creature occupied is no\r\nlonger within the sphere.\r\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as\r\ndispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the\r\nspheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t\r\nnullify each other.",
